# Volleyball Stats

A single-file, fully local volleyball stat tracker. No backend, no accounts, no analytics.
Your stats never leave the device they were entered on.

**On the Mac:** double-click `index.html`.

**On the iPhone:** <https://wghackl.github.io/Volleyball-Stats/> → Share → Add to Home Screen.

## Installing on the iPhone

1. Open <https://wghackl.github.io/Volleyball-Stats/> in **Safari** (must be Safari — Chrome
   on iOS can't install home-screen apps).
2. Tap the **Share** button, scroll down, tap **Add to Home Screen**, then **Add**.
3. Launch it from the icon at least once while still on Wi-Fi. That first launch lets the
   service worker cache the app.
4. Put the phone in airplane mode and open it again to confirm it works offline.

After step 3 it never needs the network again. The page is loaded from cache, and there is
no server to talk to — the site hosts a program, not your data.

### What is and isn't on the internet

| | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| The app (HTML/JS/icons) | Public GitHub repo, served by GitHub Pages |
| **Your teams, rosters, matches and stats** | **Only in your phone's local storage** |

Nothing you type is ever uploaded. The hosted copy is byte-identical for everyone and
contains no data.

### Updating the app

Push a change to `main` and Pages redeploys within a minute or two. **Bump `VERSION` in
`sw.js` whenever `index.html` changes** — otherwise installed phones keep serving the old
cached copy forever. On the next launch the new worker takes over and the page reloads
itself once.

## Where your data lives

In `localStorage` (key `vbstats.v1`) — **not** in this folder, and not in the repo. Which
means:

- The Mac copy and the phone copy are **separate stores with no sync**. Same app, two sets
  of stats. Move data between them with the JSON export.
- Opening `index.html` in a different browser or profile shows an empty app.
- Clearing site data — or deleting the home-screen icon on iOS — erases the stats.
- iOS Safari evicts `localStorage` for ordinary sites after 7 days of no visits.
  Home-screen apps get their own storage container and aren't subject to that, which is
  another reason to install it properly rather than just bookmarking the URL.

Use **Matches → Export all data (JSON)** to back up. On a phone this is the only thing
standing between you and losing a season.

## Getting started

1. **Teams** → add your team, add players. A jersey number *or* a name is enough — neither
   is individually required.
2. **Teams** → add an opponent and its roster. For a team that won't give you names, type
   the numbers straight into the # box (`4, 9, 15, 22`) and they're added as separate
   players in one go. Rosters are reused across matches, so you build each opponent once.
3. **Matches** → pick the two teams and a date → Create.
4. **Match** → pick a player, tap stats. `+` next to the set pills starts a new set.
5. **Box Score** → full table for both teams, filterable by set, exportable to CSV.

## Phone layout

The same file reflows below 700px into a phone-first tally screen. To see it on your Mac,
just narrow the browser window (or use Safari → Develop → Enter Responsive Design Mode).

What changes:

- **Tabs move to a bottom bar**, in thumb reach.
- **Roster becomes a sticky horizontal strip** of big jersey numbers that stays visible
  while you tap, so you never scroll between "pick player" and "tap stat".
- **Nine thumb-sized stat buttons** in a 3×3 grid — the ones you tap live — each showing
  its running count for the set. The remaining eight (passing, ball-handling, serve in
  play, and the error counterparts) sit behind **More stats**, which remembers whether you
  left it open.
- A full-width **Undo last stat** button.
- Every control is at least 44px — the iOS minimum touch target.

Nothing is duplicated in the data model; it's one app with two layouts.

This layout is what you get on the installed home-screen app — see
[Installing on the iPhone](#installing-on-the-iphone) above.

## Attack placement (where the ball went)

Optional. Every attack still counts whether or not you locate it.

**Recording.** Open **Attack placement** on the Match tab, pick **Hit** or **Tip**, tap a
zone to arm it, then tap Kill / Att Error / In Play. The zone attaches to that one attack
and clears, so it can never bleed onto the next rally. The three attack outcomes are
repeated directly under the court, so the zone→outcome sequence never needs a scroll.

The court is **open by default on a desktop and closed on a phone** — the court plus the
full stat pad don't both fit above the fold at 844px. Once you toggle it, your choice sticks.

**Zones** are the positions of the team *being attacked*, drawn like a rotation sheet with
the net at the top:

```
        ——— NET ———
     4      3      2      front row
     5      6      1      back row
```

**Reading it.** The Box Score gets an *attack placement* panel per team: pick a player (or
all), filter to hits or tips, and each zone shows attacks, kills and hitting % for that
selection. Cell shading is a single-hue ramp on attack volume — the count is printed in
every cell too, so it reads fine in greyscale. **Export CSV** gives long format, one row per
player × shot × zone, easy to pivot.

Attacks recorded without a zone are counted and called out explicitly under the court
rather than silently dropped — otherwise the chart would look complete when it wasn't.

## Keyboard shortcuts (Match tab)

| Key | Stat | | Key | Stat |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `K` | Kill              | | `T` | Assist |
| `E` | Attack error      | | `Y` | Ball handling error |
| `A` | Kept in play (neither) | | `B` | Block solo |
| `S` | Ace               | | `N` | Block assist |
| `X` | Service error     | | `M` | Block error |
| `W` | Serve in play     | | `D` | Dig |
| `3` `2` `1` `0` | Pass rating / reception error | | `F` | Dig error |
| `Z` | Undo last stat    | | | |

Select a player first — shortcuts record against whoever is highlighted.

## One tap per swing

There is no separate "attempt" button, and you never need one. Attempts are derived:

```
Total Attempts = Kills + Attack Errors + Kept in Play
Hitting %      = (Kills − Attack Errors) / Total Attempts
```

A kill counts itself as an attempt. An error counts itself as an attempt. **`Kept in Play`
(`A`) is only for the third case** — a swing that terminated nothing, because it got dug or
blocked back up. Pressing it alongside a kill would inflate the denominator and understate
the player.

Serves work the same way: `Ace` and `Serve Error` are self-counting, `Serve in Play` is the
remainder.

The readout above the buttons shows the selected player's K / E / attempts / hit% for the
match, updating on every tap, so you can watch attempts climb without recording them.

Hitting % can be negative — more errors than kills — and is shown as `-.083`, red below
zero and green at or above it.
